-------------Syntax-------------
device function:
- disc:rotate @zone|empty|finished --> disc:zone zoneName
- disc:slot @zone|empty|finished >> slotId
- disc:set slotId := value|variableName
- scanner:scan >> nameOfReturnVariable
- crane:pickup @zone
- crane:drop @dropoff

transition
- -->

assign variable to device function 
- =: variable

retrieve variable 
- @variable

for
- for color in disc:slot

-------------Setup-------------
create crane named "crane"
with position at 30 named "craneIn"
with position at 60 named "craneOut"
with position at 120 named "redBox"
with posttion at 140 named "greenBox"
with position at 160 named "blueBox"

create storage named "disc"
with 8 slots
with position at slot 1 named "discIn"
with position at slot 2 named "discOut"
with position at slot 3-7 named "waiting"
with position at slot 8 named "scanning"

create camera named "scanner"
with color red
with color blue
with color green
